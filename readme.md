# The great twitter exodus - Why and how to leave twitter

## tl; dr

If you want something like twitter go to https:://mastodon.social/, click sign up, pick a server at random and follow people. It is sort of like twitter but worse. 


**First draft. Feedback and PRs welcome. But I thought it would be good to get something live**

Elon musks purchase of twitter is making the headlines. Some think it is good some think it is bad.



## Reasons to leave twitter or diversify your tweeting

* Musk is the wealthiest man in the world and has too much influence
* Musk is not necessary treating his employees at twitter with respect
* * Cancelling [wfh polices](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-10/musk-s-first-email-to-twitter-staff-ends-remote-work) with limited notice
* * Firing a lot of people [some claim with insufficient notice](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-11-04/twitter-layoffs-employee-tweets-elon-musk)
* Musk may have [borrowed against the value of the company](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/musk-risks-battle-royale-with-creditors-as-he-remakes-twitter) to fund his purchase placing the company at a higher risk of bankruptcy. This might be a reason for the cost cutting enterprise
* The exodus of employees for twitter as well as policies [may lead to functionality problems](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-twitter-will-fail-shortly/) 
* This represents an opportunity for some new form of communication to develop
* The new form of communication like mastodon might be more independent or have benefits outside of those on twitter
* Other people are doing it ([apparently half a million](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/109300967725833789) in Oct/Nov 2022) it and it might exciting and enjoyable. 

## Reasons not to leave twitter

* People assert that big tech and its advertises are too influenced by certain ideas
* Musk has expressed views regarding free speech that you may agree with
* Our world has choices you can do what you want...
* Musk may well have interesting ideas
* Much of musks decision making is visible. The incentives and behaviour of other people in charge may not have been fundamentally different - just slowe and less visible

## You don't need to fully leave

There are tools to help you exist both on mastodon and twitter (tools may exist for other services) too and share information between them.

You automatically share tweets to and from mastodon with a [crossposter](crossposter.masto.donte.com.br). 

## Related concepts and ideas.

* [Redecentralize](https://redecentralize.org/about/) the concept of decentralizing IT services for many reasons include power, control and risk-mitigation
* [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) the idea of replacing the centralized web services on which we depend (youtube, twitter, reddit) with federated equivalents with less centralized power.

# Mastodon

Many twitter users [are signing up](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/08/mastodon-what-is-it-how-do-i-join-use-find-best-server-list-change-elon-musk-twitter-leaving-social-network-alternative) to [mastodon](https://mastodon.social) a federated service similar to twitter. 

How to sign up to mastodon:

* Go to mastodon.social, pick a server to sign up to.
* Done. You can follow people from any other server and see tweets

Other things you might like to do:

* Import contacts from twitter using [debirdify](https://pruvisto.org/debirdify/)
* Automatically share posts [between twitter and mastodon](crossposter.masto.donte.com.br)

Things that you might have to do

* [Move accounts to a different server if the server is slow](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/#how-do-i-move-my-account-to-a-new-server)

## Additional benefits to switching to mastodon

* The servers you might sign up to might form a group of people or be part of an identity you value.
* The server you sign up to can provide some control over content moderation. If you dislike their policies you can move elsewhere
* The federated nature of mastodon may well make it better for tooling
* The servers makes the function of mastodon potentially easier to understand and harder for governments to control, while at the same time making it easier for individuals to have choice over the policies of their servers regarding things like content moderation.


## Limitations of mastodon and work arounds

### The people you want to follow might be on twitter

### Discovering new people and information

This will likely be the biggest limitation of mastodon compared to twitter. This is because people at twitter are paid to do this and there is a centralized pool of data that well-paid data scientists (who are perhaps considering leaving) can use to recommend you content you like. Twitter are also incentivised to maximize the amount of time people spend on their site.

The additional control that comes with mastodon may not be a bad thing, but the problem of recommendation is something that needs to be solved. 

Apparently, one work around for this is the [use of hashtags](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/#why-are-hashtags-so-important) 

## How is the server you are on maintained

With twitter a company uses lots of money to employ people to run servers. In exchange these people advertise to you and use the data you provide to make money. This is not the case of mastodon where individuals run servers for whatever reason. 

There is a question about how these servers get funded. They might be based around activity or clubs and people interested in these activities might provide funding.
