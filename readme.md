# The great twitter exodus - Why and how to leave twitter

**First draft. Feedback and PRs welcome. But I thought it would be good to get something live**

Elon musks purchase of twitter is making the headlines. Some think it is good some think it is bad.

## Reasons to leave twitter or diversify your tweeting

* Musk is the wealthiest man in the world and has too much influence
* Musk is not necessary treating his employees at twitter with respect
* * Cancelling [wfh polices](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-10/musk-s-first-email-to-twitter-staff-ends-remote-work) with limited notice
* * Firing a lot of people [some claim with insufficient notice](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-11-04/twitter-layoffs-employee-tweets-elon-musk) 
* This represents an opportunity for some new form of communication to develop
* The new form of communication like mastodon might be more independent or have benefits outside of those on twitter
* Other people are doing it ([apparently half a million](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/109300967725833789) in Oct/Nov 2022) it and it might exciting and enjoyable. 

## Reasons not to leave twitter

* People assert that big tech and its advertises are too influenced by certain ideas
* Musk has expressed views regarding free speech that you may agree with
* Our world has choices you can do what you want...

There are tools to help you exist both on mastodon and twitter (tools may exist for other services) too and share information between them.

You automatically share tweets to and from mastodon with a [crossposter](crossposter.masto.donte.com.br).
